Game should be played with the numberpad with [numlk] turned off. Using the arrows keys also works, but reduces the fuctionality. For those that prefer the use of the [A], [W], [S] and [D] keys, these also work, but with reduced functionality.

[trak_beyondrecognition1.jpg](https://opengameart.org/content/filth-texture-set-trakbeyondrecognition1jpg) was used as the source for the background image. Image was expanded to 1000x1000 using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) to overlay the image multiple times.
